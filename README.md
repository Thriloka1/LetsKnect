# LetsKnect
In this project I am trying to create a website which helps to the Job Seekers to find the right job in Right Time.
And Iam focused about the jabs available in Japan Only.
Firstly, We are having a nav bar which consists of the logo and different navigation links to various pages Eg:- jobs,companies,Blog,Login,Register.
Along with that Everyone can easily access the page by using the internal navigation links at thr Right Top of the website.
Finally you get a Demo video on how the interview process is going on and how to prepare for the interview to crack it.
